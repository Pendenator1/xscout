- **Free tier**: 2,000 minutes/month
- **Usage**: ~40 seconds per run
- **Runs**: 144 times/day = ~96 minutes/day
- **Monthly**: ~2,880 minutes
- **⚠️ Note**: You'll use ~1,440 minutes over free tier
- **Cost**: ~$0.008/minute = ~$11.52/month over limit

### Google Gemini AI:
- **Cost**: $0 (FREE)
- **Limit**: 15 requests/minute, 1M tokens/day

### 💡 To Stay Free:
Reduce frequency to every 15 minutes instead of 10:

cron: '*/15 * * * *'  # 96 runs/day = 2,880 minutes/month (fits free tier)
```
