## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings You Can Adjust

In `.env`:

| Setting | What It Does | Recommended |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `AI_MIN_LEAD_SCORE` | Minimum score to process | Start with 7 |
| `ENABLE_AI_FEATURES` | Turn AI on/off | `true` |
| `AUTO_REPLY` | Enable AI replies | `true` |

**Tip:** If you're getting too many notifications, increase `AI_MIN_LEAD_SCORE` to `8`. If too few, lower it to `6`.

## üîç How AI Scores Leads

- **10/10**: "Need React dev, $5k budget, start Monday"
- **9/10**: "Looking for full-stack developer for e-commerce site"
- **7/10**: "Anyone know a good web developer?"
- **5/10**: "Thinking about getting a website"
- **2/10**: "Websites are cool" (not a real lead)

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Watch the scores** for a few hours to understand AI's judgment
2. **Adjust threshold** based on how many leads you want
3. **AI replies are contextual** - they reference the person's tweet
4. **All automatic** - just let it run!

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Not seeing "[+] AI Features enabled"?**
- Your API key might be invalid
- Check GEMINI_API_KEY in .env
- Get a new one: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

**Getting too many/few leads?**
- Adjust AI_MIN_LEAD_SCORE in .env
- Higher number = fewer, better leads
- Lower number = more leads, some noise

**AI replies not working?**
- Check AUTO_REPLY=true in .env
- Verify PORTFOLIO_URL is set
- Make sure Twitter has Read+Write permissions

## üìà Next Steps
